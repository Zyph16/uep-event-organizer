        <p>UEP Facility Booking System is a web-based platform that simplifies how students and 
        staff reserve university facilities. It's built to replace manual, paper-based booking with 
        a faster, more organized process.
        This system was developed to eliminate manual processes, reduce paperwork, and minimize scheduling 
        conflicts that often occur with traditional booking methods. By going digital, we ensure faster approvals,
        real-time availability, and better coordination across departments.
